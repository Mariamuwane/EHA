    <em>Nobody’s</em> born smart. We all start at 0. Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do <em>algebra.</em><br>
    Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. Nobody’s good at <strong>anything</strong> at first.<br>
    There was a time when Einstein couldn’t <strong>count</strong> to 10.<br>
    And Shakespeare had to learn his <em>ABCs</em> just like the rest of us.<br>
    Thankfully, we are born to <strong>learn</strong><br>
    Slowly. Surely. You <em>stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.</em><br>
    <strong> Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</strong><br>
    Until one <em>day</em>, you <strong>walk</strong>.<br>
    <strong>One foot</strong> in front of the other. One <em>idea</em> on top of the next.<br>
    Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit <strong>stronger</strong>.<br>
    <em>Failing</em> is just another word for <strong>growing.</strong> And you keep <strong>going.</strong><br>
    <strong>This is. learning.</strong><br>
    It’s not that <em>you don’t get it.</em> <br>
    You just don’t get it, <strong>yet.</strong>
    Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
    are built on basic ideas that <strong>anyone, anywhere can understand.</strong><br>
    Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
    You only have to <em>know</em> one thing:<br>
    <strong>You can</strong> learn anything.
